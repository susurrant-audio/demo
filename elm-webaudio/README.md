elm-webaudio
============

The `elm-webaudio` library connects your [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/) programs
to the [Web Audio API](http://webaudio.github.io/web-audio-api/). This library
is somewhat experimental and incomplete, but it is useable. Check out an example
of the library in use: [oscillator scales](http://www.squeg.net/elm-webaudio/Scales.html).

And another, much more complicated example:
[soundcloud](http://www.squeg.net/elm-webaudio/Visual.html).

I highly recommend you check out the documentation for the Web Audio API to
make sure you understand the concepts before trying to use this library. This
library basically represents a fairly thin wrapper around the Web Audio API,
so everything in the Web Audio API documentation applies.
